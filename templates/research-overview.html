  <h3><strong>Research Overview</strong></h3>
  <p class="text-justify">I have a longstanding interest in logics, modelling and automated formal methods (including model checking and constraint solving), and, more recently, their application and integration in health care.</p>
  <p class="text-justify">I am particularly interested in methods to detect and resolve problems in polypharmacy, avoiding inappropriate drug therapies and guaranteeing  medication safety. A recent paper “Avoiding Medication Conflicts for Patients with Multimorbidities” presented at Integrated Formal Methods, Reykjavik, Iceland, June 1-4, 2016, shows how our techniques can be applied in this domain. This work is supported by the EPSRC project EP/M014290/1 (Automated Conflict Resolution in Clinical Pathways).</p>
  <p class="text-justify">Another aspect I am working on, is how model checking can be used for predictive and comparative analysis of cancer treatments. Here, I am particularly interested in cancer in the elderly and how treatments should take into account comordibities, frailty, and an increased risk to adverse drug reactions.</p>
  <p class="text-justify">In another project, recently awarded by the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE) under its Newton Research Collaboration Programme (Project NRCP1617/5/62) with Brazil, we explore the use of quantitative analysis techniques to improve the efficiency of complex processes in health care (with Dr R. Czekster and Dr T. Webber, UNISC, Brazil). </p>
  <p class="text-justify">Overall, I believe that working closely with clinicians and software engineers, formal methods can make a difference and contribute to the development of better clinical decision support sustems, for more informed choice and awareness of treatment options, better care andimpact on the wellbeing of patients.</p>
